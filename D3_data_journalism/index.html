          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <!-- <p> Data from the US Census Bureau provides for a multi-faceted evaluation of health risks and socioeconomic factors.  
            Based on the data, there is a positive correlation between smoking and income level:  the percentage of people 
            who smoke increases slightly with increased income.  This result is perhaps counterintuitive: smoking is often 
            associated with the blue collar population, whom many presume to make less money, and to have less formal 
            eduation (the common narrative from the US Dept. of Labor is that those with a "professional" degree make more 
            money: https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/educational). It is noted that the merits of a formal education 
            compared with on-the-job skills training is a debatable topic that is a subject for another day.  
              With respect to the available dataset, it is possible that smoking is indeed associated with the blue collar 
            population, but that this population makes more money than typically thought. It is also possible that the 
            notion that the blue collar population smokes more is simply a stereotype.  Finally, cost of living is not factored 
            into income, and as such, the relative socioeconomic status across states and regions is lost in this data. 
            That is, more data would be needed to understand the a person  One thing is certain: more data is needed to understand
            the possible relationship between smoking and income level. </p> -->
